## Useful Files

- `src/data/eventInfo.js` – core event metadata such as name, dates, venue, and links
- `src/data/hackathonData.js` – hackathon rules, prizes, eligibility, and registration details
- `src/components/` – reusable page sections and UI blocks

## Customization

To update the event content, edit the data files in `src/data/` and adjust styling in `src/index.css` or component-specific CSS files.

The registration button and event links can be updated through the data configuration files so the landing page remains easy to maintain.
